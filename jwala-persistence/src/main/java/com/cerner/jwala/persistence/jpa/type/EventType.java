/**
 * This enum lists events classified by source and severity level
 *
 * Note: Initially the event type would only identify an event by source but later on it became evident that the event
 *       should also be classified by severity level but since adding severity level to
 *       {@link com.cerner.jwala.persistence.jpa.domain.JpaHistory} will require existing Cerner installations to update
 *       their db, a decision was made to have the event type describe both instead. Anyhow this can change in the near
 *       future on subsequent team design/code review.
